SongBrain Version 1.3

This program was designed for songwriters so that they can generate "random" chord progressions that hopefully inspire new ideas.  The program leans towards what is expected, but has the ability to produce a wide range of possible progressions.  This version allows for multiple different progressions to be combined forming an entire song structure.
